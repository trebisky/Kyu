bitops directory  10-2-2016

I decided to copy this entire directory,
 lock stock and barrel, about 1000 lines of code.

This directory holds files that would be in
    include/asm-generic/bitops
Such as:
    include/asm-generic/bitops/non-atomic.h

Note that these are GENERIC, so there is no reason to
    put them under arm as arm/bitops/xyz.h

So, I put them into bitops/xyz.h
