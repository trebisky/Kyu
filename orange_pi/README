A quick "state of the H3" report

7-31-2020

I am back working on this after setting it aside for about a year and a half.
Here is what works:

-- Basic Kyu works, with timer interrupts.
-- A second timer has been tested in a simple way.
-- UART0 is working as a simple polled console driver.
-- UART1,2,3 work in a preliminary way with interrupts.
-- The "power button" can generate a GPIO interrupt.
-- Additional cores can be started, but are not integrated
   with the Kyu scheduler
-- an i2c (TWI) driver is working.
-- an EMAC (network) driver is working.
    There are unsolved issues with the PHY that
    I am just bypassing.
