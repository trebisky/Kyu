Kyu network subsystem and configuration

    11-2-2022

Kyu has a network subsystem that supports UDP transfers nicely, along with
working DNS, DHCP, and TFTP tools that use it.

As of this writing, TCP is unfinished and experimental.
3 different TCP subsystems exist, as follows:

1) An unfinished "written from scratch" Kyu TCP subsystem.
2) A port of the Xinu TCP code that has unsolved issues.
3) A port of the BSD4.4 TCP code that is currently in progress.

To change the build to switch between these, several things need to
be configured by hand.

1) in the file kyu.h select one of the three by uncommenting
the appropriate line, i.e. -- 

    #define WANT_TCP_BSD

2) in the Makefile, include one of the three in the OBJS link
by uncommenting one of the 3 options, i.e. --

    OBJS += tcp_bsd.o

That should do it.
