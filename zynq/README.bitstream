Handling bitstreams in this code:

1) The utility "bitread" is required, which converts a bitstream file
like "bozo.bit" into C code (namely pl_data.c).

2) Various C drivers will be needed, depending on the bitstream functionality.

The first bitstream for the Antminer S9 allows the four onboard LED to
be controlled via EMIO.
