9-23-2018 - in tcp_xinu -- I replaced disable/restore calls with INT_lock/INT_unlock.
But this leaves me wondering why interrupt locking is needed at all here.
It is done only in timer.c and mq.c and I don't see why a locking semaphore
would not suffice.  Also scan this carefully for races involving Xinu wait/signal.
