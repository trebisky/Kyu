Kyu project -- allwinner directory

December 29, 2025

These are shared files (drivers)
for the H3 and H5 chips.

Amazingly the aarch32 H3 chip and the aarch64 H5
chip have identical peripherals.
The same register layout, address map,
and even interrupts.

I keep the common source files here and link to
them from the h3 and h5 directories.
